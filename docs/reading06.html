<p>In these essays, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> discusses the process of creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company">startup</a>
and the generation of wealth in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole
working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for
forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays
especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you make of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>'s pitch about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company">startup</a>s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet
would be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get
rich for hundreds of years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you find the possibility of creating your company enticing or
frightening?  Is this something you have pursued before or wish to pursue
in the future?  Do you wish to retire early or work for a long time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you make of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>'s idea of resilience and persistence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks.
Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if you
can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a small scale.
But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience means setbacks
can't change your morale, not that they can't change your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a quality find in yourself?  Is resilience necessary for success?
If so, how have you developed it during your time at Notre Dame.  If not,
what is required for success?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> made his fortune by targeting the web.  What do you
think is the next big technological platform? IOT? Wearables? VR? Web?
Mobile? Desktop? If you had to make an application today, what would you
target and why?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does the prominence of modern hackers such as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> say about
our our notions of success and the qualities required to achieve it.  Should
our society and culture encourage risk taking and starting businesses?  What
is the next big thing?</p>
