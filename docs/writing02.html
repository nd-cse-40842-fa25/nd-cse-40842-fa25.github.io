<p>The second part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a> is entitled
  "Hardware Hackers" and discusses a second wave of hackers who sought to
  "tak[e] the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> to the streets ... [and] promote a version of
  the hacker dream that would ... spread the computer gospel through, all
  things, the marketplace".</p>

<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How were the "True Hackers" and the "Hardware Hackers" similar?  How were
  they different?  How did they view each other?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did the "Hardware Hackers" manifest the desire to "dissipate the 'aura
  of elitism, and even mysticism, that surrounds the world of technology'"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the tensions that emerged as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> spread beyond
  "the limited, monastic communities around the machine, to a world where the
  machines were everywhere" via commercialization?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you agree with Lee Felsenstein that technology can be a force for good,
  or do you side with Efrem Lipkin that is a dangerous tool of oppression?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How important is spreading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> to a wider audience?  Is
compromising ideals (abandoning parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a>), worth having a
larger impact on the world (and coincidently more financial success)?</p>
