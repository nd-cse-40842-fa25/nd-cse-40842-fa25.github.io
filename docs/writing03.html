<p>The readings for this week are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part Three. GAME HACKERS</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The third part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a> is entitled
"Game Hackers" and discusses the third generation of hackers who "had learned
their programming artistry on small computers, ... [and] who dreamed not only
of the ultimate hack, but of fame, and big royalty checks."</p>

<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With the rise of the "hotshot programmer" whose "consolation was money",
  how do the "game hackers" compare and contrast from the previous two
  generations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you make of the idea that "now that there was a marketplace, [and]
  the real world had changed hackerism" to the point that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Williams_(game_developer)">Ken Williams</a> "was
  convinced that hackers should be stifled; what's needed is to guess what
  the marketplace wants, access to distribution channels, money, gimmicks,
  market promotion."?</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-col">
<p>Reflect on your thoughts regarding the following questions posed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy">Steven Levy</a> as "the Hacker Ethic ... met the marketplace":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Did you really benefit from your computer if you did not program it?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Did the public benefit from one company 'owning' a piece of software
  and preventing others from making it useful?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Could they grab the ring and not be corrupted? Could whatever idealism
  existed in their mission be preserved? Could the spirit of hackerism
  survive the success of the software industry?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> truly and fully survive in a world of commercial and
proprietary software?  Is it better to be a "professional programmer, ... the
goal-oriented ... responsible engineer" or is it better to be a programmer
with "love for [computing] in [your] heart" and "hacker perfectionism in
[your] soul"?</p>
