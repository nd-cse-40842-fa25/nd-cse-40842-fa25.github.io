<h2 id="reflections">Reflections<a class="headerlink" href="#reflections" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this essay, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> discusses the culture and customs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a>
community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultures are adaptive machines. The open-source culture is a response to an
identifiable set of drives and pressures. As usual, the culture's adaptation
to its circumstances manifests both as conscious ideology and as implicit,
unconscious or semi-conscious knowledge. And, as is not uncommon, the
unconscious adaptations are partly at odds with the conscious ideology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> discusses the economics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To many people, the successes of the open-source community seem like an
implausible form of magic. High-quality software materializes ``for free'',
which is nice while it lasts but hardly seems sustainable in the real world
of competition and scarce resources. What's the catch? Is Ceridwen's cauldron
just a conjuring trick? And if not, how does ephemeralization work in this
context—what spell is the goddess speaking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Considering <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a>'s analysis of the open source culture and customs, what
drives people to participate in open source?  What benefit do they derive in
giving away their code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-col" markdown="1">
<p>What do you make of <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a>'s list of taboos:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is strong social pressure against forking projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the
moderators is frowned upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing a person's name from a project history, credits, or maintainer
list is absolutely not done without the person's explicit consent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering open source history, do these ring true?  Are these good
taboos or norms for the culture to have or do they violate the spirit of
open source?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>This semester we've discussed the idea of what a hacker is and whether or
not you consider yourself one.  Considering <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a>'s description of the <em>gift
economy</em> and the role of <strong>reputation</strong>, do you find these mechanisms and
motivations appealing?  Do you view participation in open source as a means
of "ego satisfaction" or something more?  What would entice you or motivate
you to participate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-col" markdown="1">
<p>In regards to selling software, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> argues that there is more value in
selling services on top of software than selling software itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The foregoing begins to give us some insight into why open-source
software increasingly poses not merely a technological but an economic
challenge to the prevailing order. The effect of making software `free',
it seems, is to force us into that service-fee–dominated world—and to
expose what a relatively weak prop the sale value of the secret bits in
closed-source software was all along.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you make of this idea of "services instead of software" business model?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-col" markdown="1">
<p>To summarize the trade-off between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a> and proprietary software,
ESR remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The closed-source approach allows you to collect rent from your secret
bits; on the other hand, it forecloses the possibility of truly
independent peer review. The open-source approach sets up conditions for
independent peer review, but you don't get rent from your secret bits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When is it better to "collect rent" and when is it better to have
"independent peer review"?</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What motivates or drives people to contribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a>? What prevents
people from doing so?  Does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a> make business sense? Is the open
source business model broken or does the magic cauldron still have power?</p>
