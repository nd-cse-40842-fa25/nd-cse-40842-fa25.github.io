<p>In this week's readings, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> discusses the early days of <a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a>
and how it grew into an overnight success:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The announcement launched Linux into the above-the-radar zone in Finland,
and it started generating publicity elsewhere, too.  A lot of the early
headlines came about because some journalist had stumbled over Linux and got
excited about it...  It was far more attention than I had expected initially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What sort of growing pains did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> face in the early days of
<a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a> and how did he deal with them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> views himself as somewhat counter-cultural in that he
disagreed with the typical mindset present in Silicon Valley over issues such
as work-life balance and job stability.  Discuss these differences and how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> differed with both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> on various
issues related to open source and operating systems..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, discuss how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> dealt with success.  How does he
define success in regards to <a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a>?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you make of <a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a>'s success?  Is it proof of the power of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hackers</a> in the <strong>bazaar</strong>?  Or was it simply a matter of fortunate
circumstances?  Will there ever be another <a href="https://opensource.org">open source</a> success story as big
as <a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a>?</p>
