<p>In these essays, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> discusses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">the Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No quiet, reverent cathedral-building hereâ€”rather, the Linux community
seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and
approaches ... out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly
emerge only by a succession of miracles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are the difference between the <strong>cathedral</strong> model of software
development and the <strong>bazaar</strong> style of software engineering.  Which models
have you experienced?  Which one do you prefer?</p>
</li>

<div class="flex-col" markdown="1">
<p>In his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> enumerates <strong>19</strong> principles
such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6: Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to
rapid code improvement and effective debugging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From your experience with software development, which of these principles
ring true?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-col" markdown="1">
<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> ends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps in the end the open-source culture will triumph not because
cooperation is morally right or software ``hoarding'' is morally wrong
(assuming you believe the latter, which neither Linus nor I do), but
simply because the closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms
race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude more
skilled time into a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you make of this? Has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a> (ie. <strong>bazaar</strong>) model
won?  Is it the future of software development?</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From your experience, which model of software development is superior: the
  <strong>cathedral</strong> or the <strong>bazaar</strong>?  Which is the future of software
  development?  Are the two models mutually exclusive?</p>
