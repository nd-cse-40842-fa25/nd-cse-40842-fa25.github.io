  ## Reflections

  In this essay, [ESR] discusses the culture and customs of the [open source]
  community:

  > Cultures are adaptive machines. The open-source culture is a response to an
  identifiable set of drives and pressures. As usual, the culture's adaptation
  to its circumstances manifests both as conscious ideology and as implicit,
  unconscious or semi-conscious knowledge. And, as is not uncommon, the
  unconscious adaptations are partly at odds with the conscious ideology.

  Likewise, [ESR] discusses the economics of [open source]:

  > To many people, the successes of the open-source community seem like an
  implausible form of magic. High-quality software materializes ``for free'',
  which is nice while it lasts but hardly seems sustainable in the real world
  of competition and scarce resources. What's the catch? Is Ceridwen's cauldron
  just a conjuring trick? And if not, how does ephemeralization work in this
  context—what spell is the goddess speaking?

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. Considering [ESR]'s analysis of the open source culture and customs, what
  drives people to participate in open source?  What benefit do they derive in
  giving away their code?

  2.  <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

      What do you make of [ESR]'s list of taboos:

      > - There is strong social pressure against forking projects.
      >
      > - Distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the
      moderators is frowned upon.
      >
      > - Removing a person's name from a project history, credits, or maintainer
      list is absolutely not done without the person's explicit consent.

      Considering open source history, do these ring true?  Are these good
      taboos or norms for the culture to have or do they violate the spirit of
      open source?

      </div>

  3. This semester we've discussed the idea of what a hacker is and whether or
  not you consider yourself one.  Considering [ESR]'s description of the *gift
  economy* and the role of **reputation**, do you find these mechanisms and
  motivations appealing?  Do you view participation in open source as a means
  of "ego satisfaction" or something more?  What would entice you or motivate
  you to participate?

  4.  <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

      In regards to selling software, [ESR] argues that there is more value in
      selling services on top of software than selling software itself:

      > The foregoing begins to give us some insight into why open-source
      software increasingly poses not merely a technological but an economic
      challenge to the prevailing order. The effect of making software `free',
      it seems, is to force us into that service-fee–dominated world—and to
      expose what a relatively weak prop the sale value of the secret bits in
      closed-source software was all along.

      What do you make of this idea of "services instead of software" business model?

      </div>

  5.  <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

      To summarize the trade-off between [open source] and proprietary software,
      ESR remarks:

      > The closed-source approach allows you to collect rent from your secret
      bits; on the other hand, it forecloses the possibility of truly
      independent peer review. The open-source approach sets up conditions for
      independent peer review, but you don't get rent from your secret bits.

      When is it better to "collect rent" and when is it better to have
      "independent peer review"?

      </div>

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > What motivates or drives people to contribute to [open source]? What prevents
  people from doing so?  Does [open source] make business sense? Is the open
  source business model broken or does the magic cauldron still have power?
