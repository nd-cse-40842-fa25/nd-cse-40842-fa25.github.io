  **Everyone**:

  Welcome to [CSE 40842 Hackers in the Bazaar], which is an elective course
  that explores the idea of a [hacker] and the practice of participating in the
  open source [bazaar].  This semester we will examine the history and culture
  of hackers and open source by reading, discussing, and reflecting on the four
  different books.  Likewise, we will apply the ideas and concepts explored in
  these books through **three group projects**.

  ## Course Overview

  <div class="flex-row" markdown="1">

  <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

  As you can see from the [course schedule](index.html#schedule), we will split
  the course into four sections (each related to a particular book):

  1. [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]: The first book examines the
  origins of [hacker culture] and the [hacker ethic] along with the early days
  of the computer revolution.

  2. [Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age]: The second book
  explores how the [hacker culture] continues to influence the ethos of the
  modern technology industry and in particular disruptive startups.

  3. [The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an
  Accidental Revolutionary]: The third book discusses the underlying principles
  and motivations for [open source] and [free software].

  4. [Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary]:  The last book
  is an auto-biography of [Linus Torvalds], the creator of [Linux] and [git].

  Each week, we will spend the Tuesday class time discussing the reading for
  the week, along with the historical, social, political, and economic issues
  related to the week's topic.

  ### Presentations

  Thursday classes, on the other hand, will focus more on the technical and
  practical aspects of the reading and may involve different presentations,
  tutorials, or hands-on activities **provided by your classmates**.  As a part
  of this course, each student must give **two individual presentations** this
  semester:

  - A [Presentation Schedule] is available on Google Drive.  You must volunteer
    for **two presentations**.

  - The first presentation must be performed before **Fall Break**, while the
    second presentation must be performed before the **last week of class**.

  - Each presentation must be between **8 - 10** minutes long and must be
    related to the week's topics.

  - A list of presentation suggestions is provided in the [Presentation
    Schedule].  Feel free to ask the instructor if you have alternative talk
    ideas that fit the topics for the given week.

  - You may partner up with one other student, but the presentation must then
    be **16 - 20** minutes long.

  - The presentation can involve a simple slide deck, hands-on activities,
    demos, or a guided tutorial (it's up to you).

  To reserve a speaking slot, fill in the a box on the [Presentation Schedule]
  and message the instructor to notify him of your reserveration (*please do so
  a few days in advance for planning purposes*).

  ### Readings

  To provide a context for our weekly discussions, you will have reading
  assignments from the books listed above and a corresponding reflection that
  you must post on your own **blog**. Unlike in some other courses, the writing
  **reflection** is due at the **end of the week** after we have discussed the
  week's topic and explored it in class.

  ### Projects

  In addition to the individual presentations and weekly writing assignments,
  you will work in teams of **2 - 3** students on **three group projects** (each
  related to one of the books above):

  1.  <div class="flex-col">

      **Retro Computing**: The first project involves creating a software or
        hardware artifact rooted in computing history.  This can involve using
        older systems or programming languages, re-creating famous classic
        programs, or utilizing resource constrained (embedded) hardware.

      *This artifact will be presented in the style of a [Homebrew Computer
      Club] talk*.

  2.  <div class="flex-col">

      **Cloud Computing**: The second project is an opportunity to explore both
        cloud computing and to learn a new programming language by building a
        web application or service.

      *This artifact will be presented in the style of a [TechCrunch]-style
      startup pitch*.

  3.  <div class="flex-col">

      **Open Source**: For the third project you have a choice:

      - <div class="flex-col">

          Make a reasonable contribution to an existing [open source] project.

          *This artifict will be presented as a case study.*

      - <div class="flex-col">

          Make a computing artifact of your choosing using the [open source]
          development model.

          *This artifact will be presented as a typical course project
          presentation and demonstration.*

  More details about the projects and the associated proposals and progress
  reports will be provided on their respective project write-ups.

  ## Slack

  For communication outside of our meeting time, we will be using Slack,
  specifically the [#cse-40842-fa25] channel:

  > [https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-40842-fa25/](https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-40842-fa25)

  There is a [class mailing list], but most day-to-day communication
  (*including office hours and homework help*) should take place on [Slack].

  [class mailing list]: mailto:fa25-cse-40842-01-group@nd.edu

  Be aware of the following:

  - You will need to signup and create a [Slack] account if you don't already
    have one.

  - You can use the web interface or download the [Slack] desktop client
    (*there are also mobile applications as well*).

  The reading for this week revolves around the origins of [hacker culture] and
  the development of the [hacker ethic]:

  1. <div class="flex-col">

      [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]

      - **Part One. TRUE HACKERS**

  </div>

  ## Reflection

  As mentioned above, you will have to write a **reflection** regarding the
  week's reading. For this course, the reading responses are due by
  **midnight** on **Sunday** at the end of the week, after we have discussed
  the material and explored the related technologies in class. The responses
  are meant to be a **reflection** on the week's activities.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  explore the origins of [hacker culture], learn about the [hacker ethic], and
  delve into the meaning of a "True Hacker":

  > 1. What exactly constitutes a "True Hacker" according to Steven Levy?
  > 2. What are some examples from the book regarding the qualities of a "True Hacker"?
  > 3. How does the portrayal of a "True Hacker" compare and contrast with your
  > previous understanding of a "hacker"?
  > 4. What is your personal reaction to the idea of a "True Hacker": do you find
  > the concept as inspirational? intimidating? repulsive?

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you **brainstorm** and **reflect**
  about the question:

  > What does it mean to be a "true hacker"?  Do you aspire to be one?  Why or
  why not?

  Your individual reflection should ultimately answer this question.

  - Does the post reference the readings, class discussions, and weekly
    activities to support the writing?

  - Does the post exhibit thoughtfulness and creative expression?

  - Does the post utilize proper grammar and style?
