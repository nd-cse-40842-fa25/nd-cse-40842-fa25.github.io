title:      "Project 03: Open Source"
body:       |

  ## Overview

  The third book of the semester, [The Cathedral and the Bazaar], examines the
  history, motivations, sociology, philosophy, and economics behind the [open
  source] movement.  In his writings, [ESR] spends a significant amount of time
  discussing different projects such as [Linux], [Mozilla], and [Fetchmail].

  The last book of the semester, [Just For Fun], examines the life of [Linus
  Torvalds] and the development of the [Linux] operating system.

  For the third project, you will have two options, based on the books above:

  1. The first option is for you to explore an existing [open source] project
  and provide a case study of it.  The artifact that you will create is a
  **presentation** that you will need to present to the class.

  2. The second option is for you to mimic [Linus Torvalds] and work on an
  [open source] project "just for fun".  Rather than work from scratch,
  however, you are to take one of your previous projects (perhaps from another
  class or a side hobby) and turn it into a presentable [open source] project
  others can not only utilize, but also contribute to.

  ## Timeline

  Regardless of which project your group selects, here is the project timeline:

  <table class="bordered">
  <thead>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Milestone</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="success-bg">

      <td>Proposal</td>
      <td>Description of proposed project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="caution-bg">

  </table>

  More details about each of these milestones is described below.

  ## Requirements

  Working in groups of **2** - **3**, students must work on one of the
  following two projects options:

  ### Option 1: Open Source Contribution

  Create an [open source] case study that meets the following requirements:

  1.  <div class="flex-col">

      The project your group studies must be a well established [open source]
      project with a reasonable amount of history such as:

      - [Mozilla]

      - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

      - [Linux]

      - [Python](https://www.python.org/)

      - [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)

      - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

      - [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/)

      - [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)

      - [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

      - [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/)

      Ideally, it would be a project that you use regularly and have an interest in.

      </div>

  2.  <div class="flex-col">

      Each member of your group must attempt to make a contribution to the
      [open source] project such as a pull request, bug report, documentation,
      etc.

      <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">

      **Note**: The contribution **does not** need to be code related.  See:
        [How to Contribute to Open
        Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

      </div>

      </div>

  3.  <div class="flex-col">

      The final **case study** must include the following topics:

      - A brief summary of what the project is, what its goals are, who is the
        target audience, and what are its key features (ie. why is it
        interesting).

      - A discussion on whether or not the project follows any of [ESR]'s 19
        principles that he enumerated in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar].

      - A discussion of what sort of [homesteading in the
        noosphere](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/)
        the project participates in (ie. how does the community communicate and
        organize itself, what sort of web properties does it run, etc.).

      - A discussion on the license the project uses and who contributes to the
        project's [magic cauldron].

      - A discussion of the process of contributing to the project, including
        evidence of your group's attempt to contribute.

      </div>

  - [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)

  - [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/)

  - [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)

  - [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)

  ### Option 2: Just For Fun

  Create an [open source] project that meets the following requirements:

  -   <div class="flex-col">

      Modifies a previous project in one of the following ways:

      - Translate a project into a new programming (or spoken) language.

      - Utilize different libraries or programming language features to
        implement functionality.

      - Re-factor code to meet coding style or convention.

      - Re-factor code so it can easily be installed or deployed or fit within
        a package management system.

      - Adds new functionality or features.

      </div>

  - Provides downloadable packages or binaries for the end-user to utilize.

  - Includes a `LICENSE` file which contains the [open source] license for the
    project.

  -   <div class="flex-col">

      Has a web page that describes and advertises their project (with
      screenshots or video).

      - This web page should discuss the origin or inspiration for the project
        and its ultimate end goal or milestones.

      - Likewise, it should provide a set of documentation for installing and
        utilizing your program.

      - Finally, it should provide information about how to contribute and
        develop the project.

      </div>

  The source code for your project should be stored on an online repository
  such as [GitHub], [GitLab], or [Codeberg].

  #### Examples

  Here are some real world examples you should strive towards:

  - [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)

  ## Proposal

  Your group must submit a proposal document by **midnight** on **Thursday,
  November 6**, which provides the following information:

  1. Lists the group members and each of their proposed roles.

  ### Option 1: Open Source Contribution

  2. Identify the [open source] project your group wishes to study and explain
  why it was chosen.

  3. Describe the possible contributions you will attempt to make to the
  project (and which group members will be working on the contributions).

  ### Option 2: Just For Fun

  2. Describe the proposed project and how it meets the project requirements.

  3. Explains how the original project will be converted into an [open source]
  project and what modifications will take place.

  ## Progress Report

  Your group must submit a proposal **slide deck** (**3 - 6** slides) by
  **midnight** on **Thursday, November 20**, which provides the following
  information:

  1. Addresses the questions and expectations in feedback email provided
  regarding the project proposal.

  2. Summarizes the work done thus far, in particular the status of your
  contributions to the [open source] project and what sort of community
  interaction your group has experienced (**option 1**) or the design and
  implementation details of your artifact (**option 2**).

  3. Enumerates the remaining tasks, with specifics on what you plan on
  accomplishing during the upcoming sprint week and what you realistically plan
  on accomplishing before the deadline.

  4. Itemize contributions to the project thus far and how each member
  will aid in completing the tasks above.

  <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">
  Provide **video** or **image** evidence of your project and your progress.
  </div>

  ## Presentation

  Each group will have approximately **4** to **6** minutes to present the
  case study of their chosen [open source] project or to present their own
  [open source] project.

  For the [open source] contribution option, address the questions in the
  requirements.  For the "Just For Fun" option, describe the origins of your
  project, the modifications you made, and your future plans for new
  contributions.

  To help you organize your **presentation**, your group must submit a project
  **slide deck** (**6-10** slides) by **midnight** on **Wednesday, December
  03**, which provides the information described in the requirements.

  ## Rubric

  The project will be graded with the following rubric:

  <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
  <thead>
    <th>Metric</th>
    <th>Points</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
