  **Everyone**:

  The second book of the semester, [Hackers and Painters], examines the power
  of [programming languages] in enabling the rapid development of web
  applications and services such as [Viaweb].

  The goal of the second project is for you to explore a **modern** or
  **unconventional** [programming language] by creating an **web application or
  service** that runs *in the cloud*.  In addition to creating a software
  artifact, students must also present a [TechCrunch]-style startup pitch that
  demonstrates and highlights the features of their software artifact.

  ## Requirements

  Working in groups of **2 - 3**, students must create a software or hardware
  artifact that meets the following requirements:

  1.  <div class="flex-col">

      The artifact is written primarily in a relatively **modern** or
      **unconventional** programming language such as:

      <table markdown="1">
      <tbody markdown="1">
      <tr markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">

      - [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
      - [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
      - [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
      - [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
      - [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)
      - [Go](https://golang.org/)
      - [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
      - [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

      </td>
      <td>

      - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
      - [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
      - [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
      - [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
      - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
      - [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
      - [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
      - [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

      </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

      Moreover, the artifact must utilize a **unique** feature of the language
      such as:

      - Functional Programming
      - Meta-programming (ie. macros)
      - Concurrency/Parallel Constructs
      - Advanced Type Facilities

      <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">
      The important thing is that you stretch your mind a bit :].
      </div>

      </div>

  2. The artifact is a web application (**interactive**) or web service
  (provides a [RESTful] API).

  3. The artifact must be hosted on a cloud platform such as [Amazon Web
  Services], [Windows Azure], [Google Cloud], [Vercel], or [Digital Ocean].

  4. The source code is stored on an online repository such as [GitHub],
  [GitLab], or [Codeberg].

  5. The project includes sufficient documentation to build, deploy, and use
  the artifact.

  6. The repository `README.md` explains the goal of the project and describes
  how it takes advantage of the **unique** features of the chosen
  **non-traditional** programming language.

  <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-code"></i> MVP

  Because of the short time-frame, it is not expected that your artifact be
  polished or feature complete.  Instead, it should be more along the lines of
  a prototype or [MVP] (e.g. a cool [hack]).

  ## Timeline

  Here is the project timeline:

  <table class="bordered">
  <thead>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Milestone</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="success-bg">
      <td>October 2</td>
      <td>Proposal</td>
      <td>Description of proposed project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="caution-bg">
      <td>October 9</td>
      <td>Progress</td>
      <td>Status report of current progress.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg">
      <td>October 14</td>
      <td>Hackathon</td>
      <td>Group work period.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg">
      <td>October 16</td>
      <td>Presentation</td>
      <td>In-class presentations and demonstrations.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  More details about each of these milestones is described below.

  ### Proposal

  Your group must submit a proposal document by **midnight** on **Thursday,
  October 2**, which provides the following information:

  1. Lists the group members and each of their proposed roles.

  2. Describe the proposed project and how it meets the project requirements.

  3. Enumerates any resources required.

  <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">

  ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "cash" | embed_icon }}</i> Cloud Computing Resources

  If you need any cloud computing resources, many platforms such as [Amazon Web
  Services], [Windows Azure], [Google Cloud], [Vercel], and [Digital Ocean]
  have free tiers or promotional credits.

  </div>

  ### Progress

  Your group must submit a proposal **slide deck** (**5 - 8** slides) by
  **midnight** on **Thursday, October 9**, which provides the following information:

  1. Addresses the questions and expections in feedback email provided
  regarding the project proposal.

  2. Summarizes the work done thus far, in particular the design and
  implementation details of your artifact.

  3. Enumerates the remaining tasks, with specifics on what you plan on
  accomplishing during the upcoming sprint week and what you realistically plan
  on accomplishing before the deadline.

  4. Itemize contributions to the project thus far and what how each member
  will aid in completing the tasks above.

  <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">
  Provide **video** or **image** evidence of your project and your progress.
  </div>

  ### Presentation

  Because we are aiming for a [TechCrunch]-style presentation, each group will
  be given **6 - 8 minutes** to sell the class on their artifact:

  <div class="centered">
  <iframe width="640" height="360"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-GVd_HLlps" frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
  picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

  To help you organize your **pitch**, your group must submit a project **slide
  deck** (**4-6** slides) by **11:00 AM** on **Thursday, October 16**, which
  provides the following information:

  1. Demonstrate the web application or service.

  2. Describe the design and architecture of the software project.

  3. Discuss how project took advantage of unique features in the chosen
  programming language.

  This slide deck should be used as the basis for the **pitch** that the group
  will provide to the class.

  ## Rubric

  The project will be graded with the following rubric:

  <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
  <thead>
    <th>Metric</th>
    <th>Points</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr class="success-bg">

  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
